# SNES2GP
A DIY adapter for using SNES controllers on vintage IBM PC Compatibles.

The SNES-2-GP was created for the exact purpose of bringing a good controller to the Vintage PC community. The truth is, I was playing Duke Nukem one day and thought,”This would be so much fun if I had a controller to play it with.” And then it hit me, I could create one that worked through the Gameport. At first, I decided that I would just hack a reproduction NES controller to work with the Gameport. However, this project only sent me down the rabbit hole of what would become one of the best projects I have completed yet.
